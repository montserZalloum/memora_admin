## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**Phase 14 decisions:**
- Use individual Redis keys with pipeline MGET (not HEXPIRE) for Redis <7.4 compatibility
- Limit Frappe batch fetch to 50 profiles to avoid timeouts
- Empty display_name treated as missing, apply fallback
- Use set_value with expires_in_sec for Frappe cache TTL
- Hourly idempotency via Redis key rather than daily task log
- Rename avatar_url to avatar in LeaderboardEntry (file identifier, client constructs URL)
- Register ProfileService in app.state for pub/sub cache invalidation

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Research notes for v1.3:**
- N+1 query risk: Must use Redis pipeline for batch profile fetch from day 1 (RESOLVED: pipeline MGET implemented)
- Performance target: Leaderboard with profiles must stay under 25ms (was 20ms raw) (RESOLVED: batch fetch implemented)
- Session invalidation deferred: Removed devices work until token expiry (15 min acceptable)
