### v1.2.1 Gap Closure (Phase 13) — ACTIVE

- [ ] Phase 13: Plan Cache Invalidation Fix (0/1 plans)

**Goal:** Wire Plan cache invalidation into FastAPI pubsub listener

**Gap Closure:**
- Integration: FastAPI pubsub → Plan cache invalidation (`type="plan"` messages ignored)
- Flow: Plan save → Build → CDN → Cache invalidation (steps 8-9 broken)

**Tasks:**
1. Add Plan invalidation handler in `pubsub.py` for `type="plan"` messages
2. Register PlanService in `app.state` during lifespan (main.py)
3. Call `plan_service.invalidate(plan_id)` on plan cache invalidation messages
